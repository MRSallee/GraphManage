Modify JSON clientside (JS)

Front end
----
- Implement brand/phones/suffix/filename functions

And for when you make a frontend for file uploading, my php script looks for 
<!-- Adding files -->
<form action="upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="file">
  <input type="text" name="brand">
  <input type="text" name="name">
  <input type="text" name="suffix">
  <input type="hidden" name="function" value="add-file">
</form>

<!-- Deleting files -->
<form action="upload.php" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="brand">
  <input type="hidden" name="name">
  <input type="hidden" name="suffix">
  <input type="hidden" name="del-file">
</form>

rn it uses the suffix name for deleting both the suffix and file from the json

Although I just remembered I need to update my script so it deletes the actual file as well
As long as the file is being sent through a post request it should be fine with no modification on my part
One important thing to keep in mind, when sending files with form you need to have
enctype="multipart/form-data"
k
in the form attributes
It won't work otherwise
